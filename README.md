# üöÄ Crypto Price Tracker & LSTM Predictor

A full-stack project to fetch, display, and predict real-time cryptocurrency prices using CoinGecko API (frontend) and advanced LSTM machine learning (Python backend).

---

## ‚ú® Features

- *Real-time crypto prices:* Fetches live prices for top cryptocurrencies from the CoinGecko API.
- *Modern frontend:* Interactive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (/frontend).
- *ML backend:* Python Flask API with LSTM model for price prediction (/backend).
- *Modular:* Easy to customize and expand.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
Open frontend/index.html in your browser.  
For real API-demo: ensure backend server is running.

### 2. Backend (Python LSTM API)
Go to the backend folder and run the commands given in run.txt
The backend will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default.

## üß† How Predictions Work

- *Input:* Recent historical prices for a specific coin (e.g., Bitcoin)
- *LSTM neural network* predicts future prices based on past data  
- *Prediction API:* The backend returns predicted price to the frontend
